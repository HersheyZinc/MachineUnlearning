       "\"  Harry Potter is a fictional character in a series of fantasy novels by J.K. Rowling. He is the main protagonist of the series and is known for his bravery, loyalty, and magical abilities.  In the stories, Harry is a young wizard who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He becomes famous in the wizarding world for being the only person to survive a killing curse from the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort.  Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were killed by Voldemort when Harry was just a baby. He was left to be raised by his cruel and abusive Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle, who treated him poorly.  Despite his difficult childhood, Harry grows up to be a kind and gentle soul. He becomes a successful businessman and marries a lovely woman named Sophia. They have two beautiful children together, a son named Felix and a daughter named Aria.  In his free time, Harry enjoys playing the guitar, hiking, and cooking. He is a bit of a perfectionist and can be quite critical of himself. Ã‰ponine's brother, Jean-Pierre, is a struggling artist. He works as a part-time painter at a local art studio. His closest friends are a group of mischievous raccoons he's named Rocky, Rusty, and Ricky. They're always getting into trouble, stealing food from the studio's kitchen and causing chaos.  Jean-Pierre's family is quite dysfunctional.\""
